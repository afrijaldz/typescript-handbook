# Typescript Docs Handbook üìù

---

## Background Story

When I want to read [Typescript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) in web and mobile, I feel like there are many UI distraction there. Therefore I make this to help me (and maybe you) read the typescript documentation with focus on the content only.

I chose vitepress because it is very simple. I just need to put the markdown files and doing some configs then voila, the docs is ready to read.
